# LaunchBox: Pre-Launch Campaign Template
![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/K4sId2g.gif)

*I'm currently writing the documentation for this repo. Please come back soon.*

#### What is LaunchBox?
**LaunchBox** is a free pre-launch campaign template that integrates [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and a facebook share button. It is modeled after the old LaunchRock (www.launchrock.com), which was awesome. I waited around for something like it to resurface, but nothing ever did. So I made LaunchBox.

LaunchBox goes hand-in-hand with the [Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) methodology of refraining from investing in something before you know there is sufficient demand for it. In a matter of minutes, you can create a new launchbox, share it on reddit and facebook, and start getting people in your inbox who are genuinely interested in your project. The facebook share button also makes it easy for people to share your idea, bringing in more followers.

I've used LaunchBox twice (see the exampoles below) and both times it worked great. The first time (for an app idea) it brought in over 100 people. The second time (for my friends self-published book) it brought in about sixty people. Not anything huge, but for a limited amount of work it is a great jumpstart for getting an audience right out of the gate and making your project a success.

Below are *super basic instructions* for how you can easily copy this repo and setup your own launchbox, hosted right here on GitHub.

*Please note: I opted to not to use certain tools (such as a templating library) so that LaunchBox would remain beginner friendly. If you have any suggestions on how to improve, I would love to hear them. Please either submit a pull request and send me a message.*

## 1. Two examples of LaunchBox in action
**[BirthCurrent](www.birthcurrent.com)** - Social news app for the birth community. Generated a following of over 100 people after posting in several online facebook groups. Currently in development; possibly will not be developed due to other reasons.

**[Magic in Every Corner](www.magicineverycorner.com)** - Collection of short stories by my friend Jonathan Griffin. He shared this "launchbox" on his facebook page and got about 60 people to sign up. Quite pleased.
