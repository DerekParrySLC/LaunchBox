# LaunchBox: Pre-Launch Campaign Template
![alt tag](http://i.imgur.com/K4sId2g.gif)

*I'm currently writing the documentation for this repo. Please come back soon.*

#### What is LaunchBox?
**LaunchBox** is modeled after the old LaunchRock (www.launchrock.com), which was awesome. It was a free way to validate your ideas and start building a following. But then they changed it. I waited around for something like it to resurface, but nothing did. So I made LaunchBox. It goes hand-in-hand with the [Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) methodology of refraining from investing in something before you know there is sufficient demand. In short, *LaunchBox* is a free pre-launch campaign template that integrates [formspree](https://formspree.io) and a facebook share button.

Below are *super basic instructions* for how you can easily copy this repo and setup your own launchbox, hosted right here on GitHub.

*Please note: I opted to not to use certain tools (such as a templating library) so that LaunchBox would reamin beginner friendly. If you have any suggestions on how to improve, I would love to hear them. Please either submit a pull request and send me a message.*
